# karma-msbuild-reporter

> Reporter for MSBuild CI.

For more information on Karma see the [homepage].

This reporter reports errors well enough for MSBuild to detect them as a problem, therefore killing the build.

The difference between this package and https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-msbuild-reporter is this one contains fix for karma 0.11.
